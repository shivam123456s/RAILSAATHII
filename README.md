# Editable Buttons Web Application

This project allows users to dynamically manage a set of buttons with customizable labels and links. The application consists of a frontend hosted on GitHub Pages and a backend that stores and updates button data.

## Features
- Display a list of buttons with editable labels and links.
- Update button labels and links through a modal.
- The data is saved dynamically via the backend.
- Frontend hosted on GitHub Pages.
- Backend deployed on a platform like Heroku/Vercel/Render.

---

## Project Structure

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML: `index.html`
  - CSS: `styles.css`
  - JavaScript: `script.js`

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js server running with Express.
  - Uses a local JSON file to store button data (can be expanded to use a database if needed).
  
---

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally and deploy it, youâ€™ll need:

- **Node.js** (for the backend)
- **GitHub Account** (for the frontend on GitHub Pages)
- **Heroku/Vercel/Render Account** (for the backend)

---

## Setup and Deployment

### 1. **Frontend Setup (GitHub Pages)**

1. **Create a GitHub repository** for the frontend.
2. **Push the frontend files** (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to the repository.
3. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to the **Settings** of the repository.
   - Scroll to the **GitHub Pages** section.
   - Select the `main` branch as the source.
4. Once done, your frontend will be available at:
   ```
   https://username.github.io/repository-name/
   ```

### 2. **Backend Setup (Heroku/Vercel/Render)**

1. **Create a new Node.js app** on your chosen platform (Heroku/Vercel/Render).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the backend folder (where the Node.js server is).
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Push the backend to your hosting platform**:
   - For **Heroku**, you can use the Heroku CLI to deploy.
   - For **Vercel/Render**, connect the GitHub repository to deploy your backend.
5. Your backend will be accessible at a URL like `https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com` (or similar).

### 3. **Connecting Frontend and Backend**

1. Update the **API URL** in the `script.js` file to point to the live backend URL (Heroku/Vercel/Render):
   ```javascript
   fetch('https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com/buttons')
     .then(response => response.json())
     .then(buttons => {
       // Handle buttons data
     })
     .catch(error => console.error('Error loading buttons:', error));
   ```

2. Your frontend, hosted on **GitHub Pages**, will now interact with the backend to retrieve and update button data.

---

## Usage

1. **Frontend:**
   - The user can see a list of buttons.
   - Each button is editable by double-clicking on it.
   - Changes made in the modal are sent to the backend for updating.
   
2. **Backend:**
   - The backend handles the logic for saving and updating button data (stored in a JSON file for simplicity).
   - The backend will respond with success or failure messages for any updates.

## Troubleshooting

- **404 Not Found Error for Backend**:
  - Ensure your backend is properly deployed and running on the correct platform.
  - Check that the backend URL in `script.js` points to the live server, not `localhost`.
  
- **CORS Issues**:
  - If your frontend on GitHub Pages and backend on Heroku/Vercel/Render are on different domains, make sure CORS is enabled on the backend (handled with `cors` middleware in the Node.js app).
