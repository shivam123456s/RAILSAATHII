# Chatbot Implementation Plan

## Information Gathered:
- **HTML Structure**: The chatbot button and container are already defined in `index.html`. The chat container includes a header, message area, and input box.
- **CSS Styles**: Existing styles for the chat button and container can be reused. Additional styles for animations and responsiveness will be added.
- **JavaScript Logic**: The existing event listener structure can be adapted for the chatbot functionality.

## Plan:
1. **index.html**:
   - Ensure the chatbot button (`#chat-button`) and chat container (`#chat-container`) are correctly positioned and styled.
   - Modify the chat container to include a welcome message when opened.

2. **styles.css**:
   - Add styles for the chatbot button hover effect (pulse animation).
   - Ensure the chat container is responsive and visually appealing.

3. **script.js**:
   - Add an event listener for the `chat-button` to toggle the visibility of the chat container.
   - Implement functionality to capture user messages and display them in the chat area.
   - Use `setTimeout()` to simulate a delay for the bot's response.
   - Implement auto-scrolling to the latest message in the chat area.

## Dependent Files to be Edited:
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `script.js`

## Follow-up Steps:
- Verify the changes in the files.
- Test the chatbot functionality on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Ensure the chatbot is visually appealing and user-friendly.
